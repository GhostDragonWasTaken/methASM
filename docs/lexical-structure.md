# Lexical Structure

This document covers the low-level syntax of MethASM: comments, identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.

## Comments

Line comments start with `//` and extend to the end of the line. Everything after `//` is ignored by the compiler.

```masm
// Line comment: everything from // to end of line is ignored
var x: int32 = 42;  // inline comment
```

Block comments are not supported. Comments cannot be nested; a second `//` on the same line is simply part of the comment text. The sequence `//` inside a string literal is not treated as a comment; it becomes part of the string. For example, `"http://example.com"` produces a string containing `http://example.com` with no comment.

## Identifiers

Identifiers name variables, functions, types, and other program elements. They must start with a letter or underscore, followed by any combination of letters, digits, or underscores. Identifiers are case-sensitive. There is no documented length limit; the lexer accepts identifiers until it hits a non-alphanumeric character. Identifiers are strictly ASCII; Unicode identifiers are not supported. The lexer uses `isalpha` and `isalnum`, which treat only ASCII letters and digits as valid. The compiler interns identifier-like names for memory efficiency; see [Compilation](compilation.md#string-interning).

```
my_var
_private
Vector3
```

## Keywords

The following words are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers.

Declarations: `import`, `extern`, `export`, `var`, `function`, `struct`, `enum`, `method`. Control flow: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, `case`, `default`, `break`, `continue`, `return`. Other: `asm`, `this`, `new`. Types: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `float32`, `float64`, `string`.

`this` is only valid inside method bodies; it refers to the receiver. Using `this` as a variable name outside a method produces an error. `new` is an expression keyword, not a statement keyword; it appears in expressions like `var p: T* = new T` and cannot start a statement by itself. `cstring` is a type alias, not a keyword; it is available as a built-in name.

## Numeric Literals

Decimal literals use digits: `42`, `0`. Hexadecimal: `0x1A`, `0xFF`, `0Xdead`. Binary: `0b1010`, `0B1111`. Floating-point: `3.14`, `0.5`, `1e-3`. Invalid literals (e.g. empty hex after `0x`) produce lexical errors.

A leading minus is not part of the literal. The expression `-17` is parsed as the unary minus operator applied to the literal `17`. So `var x: int8 = -128` is valid: the literal `128` is negated to `-128`, which fits in `int8`. Integer literals are parsed as decimal strings and must fit within the target type when used; the implementation uses `strtol`/`strtoull` internally. There is no formal maximum; values that overflow the target type may produce implementation-defined behavior.

Underscores in numeric literals (e.g. `1_000_000`) are not supported. The underscore would terminate the number and start an identifier. Use `1000000` instead.

## String Literals

Strings are enclosed in double quotes. The compiler processes escape sequences before storing the value. Supported escapes: `\n` (newline, LF), `\t` (tab), `\r` (carriage return), `\\` (backslash), `\"` (double quote), `\0` (null byte). Unknown escape sequences are preserved literally: the backslash and the following character are both stored. For example, `"\q"` produces the two characters `\` and `q`, not a single character. String literals have type `string` (see [Types](types.md)).

```masm
var msg: string = "Hello\nWorld\t\"quoted\"";
```

Multiline strings are supported. A newline inside the quotes is stored as a literal newline; the string continues until the closing quote. An unterminated string (no closing quote before end of file) produces a lexical error. There is no documented maximum length; strings are limited by available memory and source file size.

## Operators and Punctuation

Assignment `=`. Comparison `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. Logical `&&`, `||`. Arithmetic `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`. Unary `-` (negation), `*` (dereference), `&` (address-of). Member access `.`. Arrow `->`. Brackets `( )`, `{ }`, `[ ]`. Delimiters `:`, `;`, `,`.

**Operator precedence:** Multiplication, division, and modulo bind tighter than addition and subtraction. Relational operators bind tighter than equality. Logical AND (`&&`) binds tighter than logical OR (`||`). So `a + b * c` parses as `a + (b * c)`, and `a < b == c` parses as `(a < b) == c`. Precedence levels (highest first): member access (`.`), multiplicative (`*`, `/`, `%`), additive (`+`, `-`), relational (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), equality (`==`, `!=`), logical AND (`&&`), logical OR (`||`). Use parentheses to override.

**Modulo:** The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of integer division. It requires integer operands. See [Expressions](expressions.md).

**Bitwise operators:** Bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), complement (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`) are supported for integer types. The unary `&` is address-of; the binary `&` is bitwise AND. Context disambiguates.

**Logical operators:** Short-circuit logical AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) are supported.

**Arrow `->`:** The arrow serves two roles. In function signatures it denotes the return type: `function f() -> int32`. In expressions it denotes pointer field access: `ptr->field`. Both uses appear in the same program:

```masm
struct Point { x: int32; y: int32; }

function get_x(p: Point*) -> int32 {
  return p->x;
}
```


## Lexer Token Model (Implementation Note)

Tokens produced by the lexer carry both:

- `value`: a null-terminated C string used by parser and semantic phases.
- `lexeme`: a string view (`data` pointer + `length`) for length-aware token text handling without `strlen`.

For identifier-like tokens, `value` points to an interned global string (deduplicated across the compilation). This enables fast pointer-based equality checks for names in later phases.
